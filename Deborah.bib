	abstract = {A simple expression is developed for the space-mean Nu (or Sh) for all Ra and Pr (or Sc) in terms of the model of Churchill and Usagi. The development utilizes experimental values for Ra approaching zero and infinity, and the theoretical solutions obtained from laminar boundary-layer theory. The expression is applicable to uniform heating as well as to uniform wall temperature and for mass transfer and simultaneous heat and mass transfer. The correlation provides a basis for estimating transfer rates for non-Newtonian fluids and for inclined plates. Even simpler expressions are developed for restricted ranges of conditions. The general and restricted expressions are compared with representative experimental data. The structure of the correlating equation shows why the common power-law-type equations cannot be successful over an extended range of Ra and Pr.},

	abstract = {For laminar flows over slender cylinders, the boundary-layer equations do not admit similarity solutions as do the laminar layers over cylinders with large radius. Consequently, the prediction of heat transfer from such surfaces requires the solution of a system of partial differential equations for different boundary conditions and Prandtl number. In the present paper we study the free-convective heat transfer from slender cylinders subject to uniform wall heat flux. This is done by solving the boundary-layer equations by an efficient numerical method described in reference (1).},

	abstract = {In the authors' previous reports, the theoretical and experimental studies on flow and temperature fields in a curved pipe were made under the condition of uniform heat flux. In the former part of the present report, a theoretical analysis is made about temperature field far downstream from the pipe inlet under the condition of uniform wall temperature, following the same procedure as in the previous papers. Nusselt number is found to be remarkably affected by a secondary flow due to curvature. The result shows that in the first-order approximation the Nusselt number of heat transfer in a curved pipe does not differ for uniform wall temperature or uniform heat flux case, in both laminar and turbulent regions. In the latter part, the formulae of Nusselt numbers obtained by the authors' study are arranged so as to have simpler expression for a practical use. It is also investigated what temperature should be chosen in calculation of physical properties when these Nusselt number formulae are used.},
